/*
	Short circuit evaluation
	In order for logical AND to return true, both operands must evaluate to true. If the left
   operand evaluates to false, logical AND knows it must return false regardless of whether the
   right operand evaluates to true or false. In this case, the logical AND operator will go ahead
   and return false immediately without even evaluating the right operand! This is known as short
   circuit evaluation, and it is done primarily for optimization purposes.

// BestPractice:
// If logical NOT is intended to operate on the result of other operators, the other
// operators and their operands need to be enclosed in parentheses.

// When mixing logical AND and logical OR in a single expression, explicitly parenthesize each
// operation to ensure they evaluate how you intend.
